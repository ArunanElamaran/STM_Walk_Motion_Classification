Modern medicine has drastically increased the average lifespan of humans. At the same time, it has failed to address the subsequent medical conditions that come with old age, particularly neurological impairments. Many of these conditions reveal themselves in subtle ways but cannot be detected until considerable damage has been done. With the evolution of ARM (Advanced RISC Machine) processors, advancements in machine learning, and accessible yet accurate sensors, a new era of electronic biomedical is on the horizon. The applications of this technology has a plethora of uses such as being able to cheaply monitor patients and detect early signs of conditions. After being introduced to the STMicroelectronicsÂ© 32 chips and learning the basics of signal processing, machine learning, and data science, we decided to develop a machine learning system that would be able to classify various walking motions. 
We developed a gait classification system driven by machine learning to potentially detect gait-impeding medical conditions, including arthritis, dementia, kidney stones, and neurological impairments.

Creating this final result required much testing using various other resources such as MATLAB and Xcode to analyze the different motions in graphical form and test the strength of our decision tree. We display this work in our Development Repository linked [here](https://github.com/rtabrizi/STMotionExploration).

Also during the development stage, we used an early version of this final project for data aqusition to then be plotted using MATLAB code. The code can be found in the "data_acquisition" branch, also linked [here](https://github.com/codeboss123/STM_Motion/tree/data_acquisition).
